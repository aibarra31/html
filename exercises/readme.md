  exercise.

The differences and definition between 'GET' and 'POST'
GET: Requests data from a specified resource
Post: Submits data to be processed to a specified resource

Some other notes on GET requests
  o GET requests can be cached, requests remain in the browser history, requests can be bookmarked, requests should never be
  used when dealing with sensitive data, requests have length restrictions, requests should be used only to retrieve data
  
Some Notes on Post requests:
  o Post requests are never cached, requests do not remain in the browser history, requests cannot be bookmarked and 
  requests have no restrictions on data length
